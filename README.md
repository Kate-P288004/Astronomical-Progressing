"# Astronomical-Progressing" 
## Overview
The **Astronomic Processing Application** is a Windows Forms application developed using C#.
Project Overview
The Astronomical Processing application is designed for a local observatory to record, process, and display the number of neutrino interactions per hour. The application uses a forms-based GUI to manage and interact with the data stored in an array of 24 integers, representing the hourly interactions over a day. The project implements sorting and searching functionalities using the Bubble Sort and Binary Search algorithms.

Client Requirements

Data Storage: All data is stored as integers in an array of size 24.
Search Functionality: The client can search the array using a text box input.
Sorting Functionality: A button allows the client to sort the data.
Data Editing: The client can edit data values using an input field (text box).
User Interface: The application uses a list box to display data and text boxes/buttons for interaction.

Program Functionality

Array Type: The array is of type integer and contains 24 elements.
Bubble Sort: The sort method is implemented using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Binary Search: The search method is implemented using the Binary Search algorithm.
Search Input: A single text box is provided for entering search queries.

Error Handling:

If the text box is empty during a search, an error message is generated.
If the search is unsuccessful, an error message is displayed.
If the search is successful, a success message is displayed.
Data Editing: The program allows for editing the data values in the array.
Random Data Generation: The array is filled with random integers between 10 and 90 to simulate the data stream.

Project Management and Source Control

Documentation: All documentation conforms to CITEMS organizational guidelines and is added to the source control.
